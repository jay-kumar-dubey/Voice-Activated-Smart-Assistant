# Voice-Activated-Smart-Assistant
Developed a voice-activated smart assistant using Python, integrating speech recognition, text-to-speech, and web automation. The assistant enables hands-free interactions for:

Fetching real-time news headlines using the News API.
Opening websites and playing music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify.
Executing custom AI responses for user queries.

This project showcases expertise in Python, APIs, web automation, and natural language processing.

You can simply run this programm and call for voice activation key, the voice assistant then response by say "How can i help you sir (you can change it to your preference)". Once activated say your command out loud for example: "play 'song-name' - it will then ask for which platform you prefer to play it on, (spotify or Youtube", similarly you can open any website without touching the keyboard just by say "open stackoverflow" and the website will open in a second. 
For new command to process you have to call for wake word again and pass your command to smart voice assistant.
